# Prompt Flow

## Overview
![Overview Image](path/to/overview-image.png)

**Prompt Flow** is an AI-orchestrated code generation and autonomous deployment pipeline that utilizes LangChain and large language models (LLMs) to empower users in developing entire projects through natural language prompts. It automatically generates a complete folder structure, writes code, and configures all necessary files for specified frameworks or languages.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: For natural language processing and code generation.
- **Docker**: For creating isolated environments for execution and testing.
- **AWS**: For cloud deployment and scalability.
- **GCP**: For cloud deployment and scalability.

## Features
### Natural Language to Code Generation

- Allows real-time execution, testing, and validation of projects in isolated environments, ensuring consistency across different stages of development and reducing local setup requirements.

## Key Comparisons
1. **Full SDLC Automation vs. Manual Setup**
   - Unlike traditional development requiring manual setup for coding, testing, and deployment, Prompt Flow automates the entire SDLC, significantly reducing time and complexity.

2. **Dynamic Web Access for Real-Time Updates vs. Static Frameworks**
   - While current tools rely on predefined support for frameworks, Prompt Flow dynamically accesses web resources for up-to-date documentation, enabling it to adapt to cutting-edge frameworks and evolving languages effortlessly.

## Comprehensive Infrastructure
